Ok that is my 3rd day in row when i am learning rust.
Starting with Enums and Pattern matching, decided to go up to vectors

Some notes from book:
```markdown
Enums allow you to define a type by enumerating its possible _variants_.
```

match:
```markdown
_match_ allows you to compare a value against a series of patterns and then execute code based on which pattern matches
```

if_let:
```markdown
The `if let` syntax lets you combine `if` and `let` into a less verbose way to handle values that match one pattern while ignoring the rest.
In other words, you can think of `if let` as syntax sugar for a `match` that runs code when the value matches one pattern and then ignores all other values.
```

Managing Growing Projects with Packages, Crates, and Modules:

```markdown
- **Packages:** A Cargo feature that lets you build, test, and share crates
- **Crates:** A tree of modules that produces a library or executable
- **Modules** and **use:** Let you control the organization, scope, and privacy of paths
- **Paths:** A way of naming an item, such as a struct, function, or module
```

Packages and Crates:

```markdown
A _crate_ is the smallest amount of code that the Rust compiler considers at a time. Even if you run `rustc` rather than `cargo` and pass a single source code file (as we did all the way back in the “Writing and Running a Rust Program” section of Chapter 1), the compiler considers that file to be a crate.
A _package_ is a bundle of one or more crates that provides a set of functionality. A package contains a _Cargo.toml_ file that describes how to build those crates.
 If a package contains _src/main.rs_ and _src/lib.rs_, it has two crates: a binary and a library, both with the same name as the package.
```

### [Modules Cheat Sheet](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch07-02-defining-modules-to-control-scope-and-privacy.html#modules-cheat-sheet)

Grouping Related Code in Modules:
```markdown
_Modules_ let us organize code within a crate for readability and easy reuse.
```

#### [Best Practices for Packages with a Binary and a Library](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch07-03-paths-for-referring-to-an-item-in-the-module-tree.html#best-practices-for-packages-with-a-binary-and-a-library)

### [Starting Relative Paths with `super`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch07-03-paths-for-referring-to-an-item-in-the-module-tree.html#starting-relative-paths-with-super)

```markdown
We can construct relative paths that begin in the parent module, rather than the current module or the crate root, by using `super` at the start of the path.
This is like starting a filesystem path with the `..` syntax.
```

```markdown
Designating an enum as public makes all its variants publi
```

there is a lot of reading but i only need to remember that once:
## [Bringing Paths into Scope with the `use` Keyword](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch07-04-bringing-paths-into-scope-with-the-use-keyword.html#bringing-paths-into-scope-with-the-use-keyword)

### [Providing New Names with the `as` Keyword](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch07-04-bringing-paths-into-scope-with-the-use-keyword.html#providing-new-names-with-the-as-keyword)

```markdown
Making a name available for any code to use from a new scope with `pub use`
```

## [Separating Modules into Different Files](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch07-05-separating-modules-into-different-files.html#separating-modules-into-different-files)

```markdown
Note that the `pub use crate::front_of_house::hosting` statement in _src/lib.rs_ also hasn’t changed, nor does `use` have any impact on what files are compiled as part of the crate. The `mod` keyword declares modules, and Rust looks in a file with the same name as the module for the code that goes into that module.
```

ok today im done with reading and the collections i leave for the next day.
