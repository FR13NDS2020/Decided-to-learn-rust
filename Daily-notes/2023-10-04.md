Today was my first day starting to learn Rust. My plan is to set everything up to be ready to work on all that I need, such as:

### To-Do List

- [x] GitHub repo
- [x] Time tracking software setup
- [x] Notes setup
- [x] System setup
- [x] Create some small projects to save what I've learned

Important notes from the book:

```markdown
Let’s recap what we’ve learned so far about Cargo:

- We can create a project using `cargo new`.
- We can build a project using `cargo build`.
- We can build and run a project in one step using `cargo run`.
- We can build a project without producing a binary to check for errors using `cargo check`.
- Instead of saving the result of the build in the same directory as our code, Cargo stores it in the `_target/debug_` directory.

When your project is finally ready for release, you can use `cargo build --release` to compile it with optimizations.

```

About shadowing:

```markdown
Shadowing is different from marking a variable as `mut` because we’ll get a compile-time error if we accidentally try to reassign to this variable without using the `let` keyword. By using `let`, we can perform a few transformations on a value but have the variable be immutable after those transformations have been completed.
```
