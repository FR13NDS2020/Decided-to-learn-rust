Today day 2# of my rust learning.
Starting with ownership in rust.

Some notes from book:
```markdown
Here are some of the types that implement `Copy`:

- All the integer types, such as `u32`.
- The Boolean type, `bool`, with values `true` and `false`.
- All the floating-point types, such as `f64`.
- The character type, `char`.
- Tuples, if they only contain types that also implement `Copy`. For example, `(i32, i32)` implements `Copy`, but `(i32, String)` does not.
```
Barrowing:
```markdown
As in real life, if a person owns something, you can borrow it from them. When you’re done, you have to give it back. You don’t own it.
Just as variables are immutable by default, so are references. We’re not allowed to modify something we have a reference to.
We _also_ cannot have a mutable reference while we have an immutable one to the same value.
```
The Slice Type
```markdown
_Slices_ let you reference a contiguous sequence of elements in a collection rather than the whole collection. A slice is a kind of reference, so it does not have ownership.
```

Structs:
```markdown
A _struct_, or _structure_, is a custom data type that lets you package together and name multiple related values that make up a meaningful group
```

Debug print:
```markdown
Another way to print out a value using the `Debug` format is to use the [`dbg!` macro](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.dbg.html), which takes ownership of an expression (as opposed to `println!`, which takes a reference), prints the file and line number of where that `dbg!` macro call occurs in your code along with the resultant value of that expression, and returns ownership of the value.
```

Method Syntax:
```markdown
_Methods_ are similar to functions: we declare them with the `fn` keyword and a name, they can have parameters and a return value, and they contain some code that’s run when the method is called from somewhere else. Unlike functions, methods are defined within the context of a struct , and their first parameter is always `self`, which represents the instance of the struct the method is being called on.
```

Associated Functions:
```markdown
All functions defined within an `impl` block are called _associated functions_ because they’re associated with the type named after the `impl`.
example:
`impl Rectangle {
    fn square(size: u32) -> Self {
        Self {
            width: size,
            height: size,
        }
    }
}`

```

ok today i am done . next will start with Enums.
